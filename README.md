Now is time to run the bot! Please see below.

### This script is to run managebot that updates itself at each restart/run. (RECOMMENDED)

```
sudo docker run -d \
--name=managebot \
--restart=unless-stopped \
--privileged \
-v /your/path/to/managebot:/your/path/to/managebot \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-w /your/path/to/managebot \
python:3.11 \
/bin/bash -c "apt-get update -y && apt-get install git && apt-get install -y docker.io && python3 -m pip install -U py-cord --pre && git checkout -- bot.py && python3 bot.py"
```

### This script is to run managebot that DOES NOT update itself at each restart/run. (NOT RECOMMENDED)

```
sudo docker run -d \
--name=managebot \
--restart=unless-stopped \
--privileged \
-v /your/path/to/managebot:/your/path/to/managebot \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-w /your/path/to/managebot \
python:3.11 \
/bin/bash -c "apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y docker.io && python3 -m pip install -U py-cord --pre && python3 bot.py"
```

### After choosing your run script, follow these instructions below.

Edit `/your/path/to/managebot` to wherever you put managebot.

**The first run of managebot usually takes around 2 minutes (depending on your internet speeds). This is just for the first run.**

Once your discord bot comes online. You are free to begin using commands.

## How to start, stop & restart the bot

The most simple way to start, stop or restart managebot is directly from the command line.

Start
```
sudo docker start managebot
```

```

```
